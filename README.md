# Credit_Risk_Analysis
---
### Purpose
##### The purpose of this project was to assess loan applications using differnt techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.
##### Imbalanced learn and scikit learn libraries were used to build and evaluate models using resampling. 
##### Random Oversampler, SMOTE, SMOTEEN, Cluster Centroids, Balanced Random Forest Classifier, and Easy Ensemble Classifier were the machine learning models used to help reduce bias in order to better predict credit risk for the applicants.
