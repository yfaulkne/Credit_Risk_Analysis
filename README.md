# Credit_Risk_Analysis
---
### Purpose
##### The purpose of this project was to assess loan applications using differnt techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.
##### Imbalanced learn and scikit learn libraries were used to build and evaluate models using resampling. 
##### Random Oversampler, SMOTE, SMOTEEN, Cluster Centroids, Balanced Random Forest Classifier, and Easy Ensemble Classifier were the machine learning models used to help reduce bias in order to better predict credit risk for the applicants.

### Results

##### 5. Balanced Random Forest Clsssifier (unable to run code due to attribute error. Please see jupyter notebook file.)
##### 6. Easy Ensemble Classifier (unable to run code due to attribute error. Please see jupyter notebook file.)

### Summary
##### Of the tests that the codes were able to run successfully, the Random OverSampler model had the highest accuracy. Accuracy can be calculated using the confusion matrix from each code and the values for True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives. For confusion matrix results, please see the jupyter notebook codes for each machine learning model. 
##### It is my reccomendation to use the Random OverSampler model as the tool for the credit risk analysis
